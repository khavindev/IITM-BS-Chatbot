Refer to the official program website for details.\nPlease note: This list only includes course names and codes. Refer to the official program website for detailed course descriptions and prerequisites.\n\nTerm Structure:\nThe program follows a flexible term structure, allowing learners to progress at their own pace.\nEach year is divided into three terms: January Term, May Term, and September Term. Each term lasts four months.\nEvery term consists of:\n12 Weeks of Coursework: Learners engage in online video lectures, complete assignments, and participate in discussions during this period.\n2 In-person Invigilated Quizzes: These quizzes are conducted at designated exam centers across India to assess learners' understanding of the course material.\nEnd-Term Exams: Learners take in-person end-term exams at designated exam centers to evaluate their overall learning outcomes for each course. (https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/academics.html)\n\nRegular Entry Process for IIT Madras BS Degree program in Data Science and Applications:\nThis section details the admission process for regular entry into the program. Here's a breakdown of the key steps:\n\nEntrance exam/Qualifier Process:\nAll regular entry applicants must qualify through the Qualifier Process to gain admission to the Foundation Level.\nThe Qualifier Process involves a 4-week online preparatory course covering foundational topics in English, Mathematics for Data Science, Statistics for Data Science, and Computational Thinking.\nLearners engage in video lectures, assignments, and live sessions during this period. Weekly assignments are mandatory for grading.\nAt the end of 4 weeks, a qualifier exam is conducted to assess learners' understanding of the covered material.\n\nEligibility for Qualifier Exam:\nThe average score of the best 2 out of the first 3 assignments in each course is calculated.\nLearners must achieve a minimum average assignment score in all four courses to be eligible for the Qualifier Exam. The minimum score varies based on the learner's category (General, SC/ST/PwD etc.).\nNote: The relaxed criteria for the Qualifier Process do not apply to the program itself once enrolled.\n\nQualifier Exam and Passing Criteria:\nOnly eligible learners receive a hall ticket for the in-person Qualifier Exam.\nThe 4-hour Qualifier Exam covers all four foundational courses.\nTo pass, learners need to achieve both a minimum average score and a minimum score in each individual course. The minimum score requirements vary based on the learner's category.\nValidity of Qualifier Exam Result:\n\nThe Qualifier Exam result is valid for 3 terms (1 year) for candidates who have cleared class 12 board exams. They can choose to join the program later within this validity period.\nThe validity is extended to 6 terms (2 years) for candidates yet to appear for class 12 exams, allowing them to join after passing class 12.\nLimitations on Foundation Level Course Registration:\nAlthough anyone who passes the Qualifier Exam can register for Foundation Level courses, the number of courses allowed in the first term is limited based on the Average Qualifier Exam Score.\n\nRe-attempting the Qualifier Exam:\nLearners who didn't clear the Qualifier Exam or were absent can re-attempt it in the same term without repeating assignments.\nRe-attempting the exam requires filling an application form and paying a fee (amount varies based on learner category).\nLearners who are not eligible to re-attempt or fail the re-attempt need to re-apply for the next term, going through the entire Qualifier Process again.\n(or)\nJEE-based Entry:\nCandidates qualified to appear for the current year's JEE Advanced exam can directly join the program by completing the application form, paying the admission fee, and registering for Foundation Level courses.\n\nInternational Students:\nThe program is open to international learners.\nIn-person exams are conducted in some countries (UAE, Sri Lanka, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman). Learners residing in these countries must appear for these exams.\nLearners from other countries can enroll and take remote proctored exams.They can contact ge@study.iitm.ac.in for further information.\n\nAdditional questions:\nDoes IIT Madras offer B.Sc in Programming & Data Science on-campus?\nNo, there is no equivalent on-campus version.

Option to change the exam city will be available till each deadline in the student Dashboard, in the \"Exam Cities and Hall Tickets\" page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
